#Simple Keylogger

A basic keylogger program in python that records and logs keystrokes.
Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

Run the code and type anything and the terminal starts recording every keystroke and the program creates a "keylogs.txt" file where it appends and records the keystrokes.
